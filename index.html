			<h1>Hello, I'm Alizée</h1>
			<img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Alizée Hervouet" style="width: 150px;height: 150px" class="img-circle">
			<p>I love learning new things because it's part of the experience we have to go through in order to become better at what we are currently doing 👨‍🎓</p>

			<h2>Stock market 📚</h2>
			<p>It allows me to make a passive income. If someone buys a stock and the company value goes up, the investment is worth more. That's why it's interesting. I am currently purchasing stocks that are related to airlines, because after the COVID-19 period people will for sure want to travel a lot !</p>

			<h2>New languages 🌍</h2>
			<p>It helps me discover, other countries, foreign language study enhances listening skills and memory. One participates more effectively and responsibly in a multi-cultural world if one knows another language. Your marketable skills in the global economy are improved if you master another language. 

			<p>I am currently studying 4 different languages English, Spanish, Chinese and Korean. Korean has to be the one I am studying by myself on a daily basis, thanks to an app called Memrise and some self study booklet.</p>

			<h2>Travel ✈️</h2>
			<p>Travel takes us out of our comfort zones and inspires us to see, taste and try new things. It constantly challenges us, not only to adapt to and explore new surroundings, but also to engage with different people, to embrace adventures as they come and to share new and meaningful experiences with friends and loved ones.</p>

			<h2>University 📚</h2>
			<p>University has to be the one THING I was waiting for in high school. But now that I was about to start my first year at ESSEC Business School, I didn't know if I would get used to my new student life and I was afraid of feeling rejected by my colleagues or by the students in my residence. And I was especially afraid that I would not pass my exams.</p>

			<p>The reality was a bit different, indeed the exams are intense, but despite this I made a lot of good friends and I still live exceptional moments especially when it comes to going to parties organised by the school </p>

			<h2>Career 💼 </h2>
			<p>My absolute dream is to have a career that allows me to travel as often as possible. The idea of staying in an office would be the worst punishment, I need a job that allows me to change activities and therefore not do the same things over and over again. At the moment I am very interested in the luxury sector, I would like to do a job related to treasury as I am the treasurer of the MODESSEC association on campus.</p>
